<h2> About Us </h2>

<p>
The Alextown Public Library opened its doors in April of 2023. 
</p>
<p>
We're a library. We have so many books. More than five! Come and see our collection, maybe check a book out. 
</p>
<p>
You can also add or remove a book to our collection, or at least, you <i>will</i> be able to remove one, once our tech team figures that out.
</p>
<p>
All totally normal stuff for a library!
